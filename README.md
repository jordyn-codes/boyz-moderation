# About The Developer
This is my last bot I will be coding. I will try to keep it updated, however.

# About The Bot
I am keeping the bot open sourced for anyone to use the code. It's written  in Javascript using Node.js and the bot is originally hosted on REPLIT. I will not give instructions on how to self-host because the bot is open-sourced to keep it trustworthy, and the code will be updated.
